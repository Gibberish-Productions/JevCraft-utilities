## What is JevCraft Utilities
JevCraft Utilities is a datapack for Minecraft created by me! JevCraft is a series of datapacks I am working on. This is the first one.

Utilities is a datapack for running a minecraft LAN or multiplayer server. It features a very simple menu. The Moderation Menu has lots of features, like killing all entities, reloading the server/world, etc.

I highly recommend you download this datapack!
